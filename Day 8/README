Hello everyone,
You learn everyday and grow, that is the main motive of life.
I got the opportunity to attend live bootcamp conducted to improve our way of thinking towards solving a given problem.
And from this day onwards I will try my best to implement what I learned and would continue to improve myself.
If someone asks, please provide some guru matra by which I would get success, so there is ONE given by our professor but its not just a matra, you have to work on it, that is
WORK HARD, SUCCESS IS YOURS...
