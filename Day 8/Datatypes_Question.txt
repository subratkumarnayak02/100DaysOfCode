Q) Given an input integer, you must determine which primitive data types are capable of properly storing that input.

Sample Input:
4
9223372036854775808
4294967296
-4294967296
-65535
256

Sample Output:
9223372036854775808 can't be fitted anywhere.
4294967296 can be fitted in:
* long
-4294967295 can be fitted in:
* long
-65535 can be fitted in:
* int
* long
256 can be fitted in:
* short
* int
* long

Solution:

1. byte has minimum value of -128 and a maximum value of 127(inclusive).
2. short has a minimum value of -32,768 and a maximum value of 32,767 (inclusive).
3. int has a minimum value of (-2^31) and a maximum value of (2^31)-1.
4. long has a minimum value of (-2^63) and a maximum value of (2^63)-1.

Steps:
1. First take the number of elements to check.
2. Then check if the number is in the range of byte,short,int or long in size.
3. Then Print the types of datatypes the number lies in, if its non of the above, print 'can't be fitted anywhere'.
